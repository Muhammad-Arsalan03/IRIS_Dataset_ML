# IRIS_Dataset_ML
I have used different machine learning algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, and decision trees) to compare the results on IRIS dataset.

we are asked in this assignment to use IRIS_dataset to compare accuracies of different Machine Learning Models.

ML_Assignment.ipynb file is the main file in which IRIS dataset is loaded, trained and tested on SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, and decision trees.
